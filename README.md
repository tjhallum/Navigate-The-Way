### Why did we open-source NTW✝️?
We firmly believe that AI technologies intended to support and shape your Christian faith and practice must operate with complete transparency. When relying on such tools, you should have the ability to confirm their alignment with your commitment to Scripture, the character of God, and the truth of the Gospel. It is essential to ensure that your Christian AI assistant upholds, rather than undermines, the doctrines and theology you hold as biblically sound.

NTW✝️ is open-sourced under the AGPL-3.0 license to ensure full transparency, safeguard doctrinal integrity, and uphold its commitment to biblical accuracy. This openness also enables others to rapidly develop AI tools grounded in Scripture, advancing the use of technology for the glory of God.

### Key Points About the AGPL-3.0 License:

 - **Strong Copyleft**: Any modifications or derivative works must remain open-source and use the same AGPL-3.0 license.
